## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts


### What I learned

Working on this challenge has helped me build on my HTML and CSS skills. Though understanding where to use flex box and grid took a little time but I was able to create a replica of the challenge result. For a Frontend Mentor challenge, this is the first time I used the linear-gradient attribute.

Here are some of the snippets of code I used in completing the challenge:

```css
.continue:hover{
    background-image: linear-gradient(hsl(252, 100%, 67%), hsl(241, 81%, 54%));
}
```

### Continued development

Flex box and grid are really important display rules that I still do have a hard time understanding. I will continue to look into these concept and learn more about it.
